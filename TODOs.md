# Things to be developed

1. Add **Local Notifications**   
Local Notifications have to be pushed when a countdown is finished. If possible, push notifications before the countdown finishes.

2. Make some **UI changes**.   
I am not good at UI Designing. So please help me to design better UIs instead of these normal UIs.

3. **Shrink the code**.   
Also, I have to shrink the code for better performance, if you can, please help me.
