# CountIt (Mobile Version)

This is a project started by me (Sahithyan) on December 2018 (Date is not in my mind when I was writing this ReadMe). It was started as a desktop app to get practice in Electron (a JavaScript framework to create Desktop apps). But when I figured that this will be very helpful if it is on mobiles. So I have started this project on January 3rd (first commit in this repository).

It helps you to create Count Downs. They are stored in Cloud (Firebase) to enable the users to access their count downs from any device.
