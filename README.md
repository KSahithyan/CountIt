## Countr (Mobile Version)

This is a project started by me (*Sahithyan*) on December 2018 (Date is not in my mind when I was writing this ReadMe). It was started as a desktop app to get practice in [Electron](https://electronjs.org/ "a JavaScript framework to create Desktop apps"). But when I figured that this will be very helpful if it is on mobiles. So I have started this project on January 3rd (first commit in this repository).
